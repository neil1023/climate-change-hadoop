# Climate Change w/Hadoop

Analyzing climate change between the years 1950 and 2016 using the NASA Nex DCP-30 Dataset!

This project looks at the major cities within the US and determines which cities revealed the greatest differences in temparature.

To run this project, just call 'sh runAvgTempCities.sh'

deltas.csv will be produced.

It should also produce a sorted_deltas.csv file which sorts the records from most amount of change to least amount of change.
